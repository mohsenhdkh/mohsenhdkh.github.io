I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at NSF Center for Science of Information (CSoI) based at Purdue University and hosted by [Wojciech Szpankowski](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/spa/).

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Michigan (2019). I was fortunate to have [Sandeep Pradhan](https://pradhan.engin.umich.edu/) as my advisor. 
I hold my M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Michigan, in 2017. 

Prioir to U of M, I received my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, Iran.

Reseach Interests
======
My research interests lie in machine learning, computational learning, information theory and quantum information theory. My recent work has focused on the following goals:
- Quantum Learning: 
- Studying quantum state classification from PAC learning perspectives (quantum sample complexity).
- Underestanding learning capabilities of quantum processors. 
- Developing PAC learning formulations in quantum settings, in particular quantum state classifications. 
- Feature selection using discrete Fourier expansion
- 
-
