I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at NSF Center for Science of Information (CSoI) based at Purdue University and hosted by [Wojciech Szpankowski](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/spa/).

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, in 2019, at the University of Michigan with [Sandeep Pradhan](https://pradhan.engin.umich.edu/) as my advisor. 
Also, I received my M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Michigan, in 2017. 


Prioir to Umich, I received my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, Iran.
