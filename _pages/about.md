I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at NSF Center for Science of Information (CSoI) based at Purdue University and hosted by [Wojciech Szpankowski](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/spa/).

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Michigan (2019). I was fortunate to have [Sandeep Pradhan](https://pradhan.engin.umich.edu/) as my advisor. 
I hold my M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Michigan, in 2017. Prioir to U of M, I received my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, Iran.

For more information see my [CV](http://mohsenhdkh.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

Reseach Interests
======
My research interests broadly lie in machine learning,  information theory and quantum information theory. My recent work has mainly focused on 
- Developing PAC learning formulations in quantum settings, with applications in quantum computing, and quantum state discrimination. 
- Statistical Learning using discrete Fourier expansion with applications in feature selection.
- Faithful simulation of quantum measurments.
